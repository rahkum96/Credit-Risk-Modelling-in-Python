# Credit-Risk-Modelling-in-Python
Credit risk refers to the chance that a borrower will be unable to make their payments on time and default on their debt. It refers to the risk that a lender may not receive their interest due or the principal lent on time.

The objective of this article is to build a model to predict probability of person defaulting a loan.

## Approach
 1. Data preparation and Pre-processing
 2. Feature Engineering and Selection
 3. Model Development and Model Evaluation

### Dependencies
 
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* XGBOOST
* seaborn
* pyhthon 3.9

## Usage

Just run `jupyter notebook` in terminal and it will run in your browser.

Install Jupyter [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) i've you haven't.

## Model evaluation
- we have acheived the final model accuracy 82%

## Steps to run this model in your system 
- Clone or download the repo.
- Open command prompt in the downloaded folder.
